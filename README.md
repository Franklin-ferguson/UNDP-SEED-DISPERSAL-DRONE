# 🌱 UNDP Drone-Based Seed Dispersal System for Afforestation  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was carried out under a **UNDP-supported initiative** on climate resilience and sustainable land management. The goal was to design and deploy an **automated aerial seed dispersal system** capable of accelerating afforestation efforts in degraded areas.  

Traditional tree planting methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often inaccessible in challenging terrains. By leveraging **UAV technology, microcontrollers, and custom software**, our system provides a **scalable, precise, and efficient solution** for large-scale reforestation.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a **customized seed dispersal module** adaptable to multi-rotor UAV platforms.  
- Integrate **microcontroller-based automation** for precise seed release.  
- Design and implement a **user-friendly mobile/desktop application** for mission configuration and real-time monitoring.  
- Validate the system through **field experiments**, testing dispersal efficiency, flight stability, and terrain adaptability.

## 🛠️ System Design & Methodology  

### 1. Hardware Development  
- Designed and fabricated a **modular seed dispersal unit** using CAD and 3D printing.  
- Integrated the module with a **TT Aviation 30L UAV** for high payload capacity.  
- Utilized **microcontrollers (Arduino-based)** to automate seed release based on GPS coordinates and flight plan inputs.  

### 2. Software Development  
- Built a **custom control application** to allow operators to configure seed dispersal parameters (e.g., density, timing, flight path).  
- The app interfaces with the UAV system, providing **real-time monitoring** of seed release status and flight data.  

### 3. Field Testing  
- Conducted controlled experiments to measure:  
  - **Seed dispersal efficiency** across various terrains.  
  - **Flight stability** under payload variations.  
  - **System reliability** under repeated deployments.  
- Collected and analyzed test data to refine release protocols and improve module design.
